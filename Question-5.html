                <p class="p"><strong><u>Foxes are omnivores, hunting very small animals and scavenging in cities and towns where freely available pet food and garbage can make life easier.</u></strong>It's not unusual for a fox to be seen out and about during the day. Foxes are afraid of people and will usually run away when they detect your presence, but they may visit your backyard or neighborhood. <br><br>
                <strong><u>Most dogs are not at risk from an attack by a fox unless they have threatened their young,</u></strong> but they still should not be left outside unattended for a host of safety reasons, including harsh weather, harassment and dog-napping. Depending on where you live, very small dogs are vulnerable to harm from a plethora of predators, including foxes, so they should be monitored when outside.Mange is a treatable condition. If you see a fox that you suspect is infected, contact a local wildlife rehabilitator.</p>
